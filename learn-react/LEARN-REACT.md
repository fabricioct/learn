# Learn React


## Commandos

npx create-react-app fundamentos-react -> When you run a package using NPX, it searches for the package in the local and global registry, and then it runs the package. If the package is not already installed, NPX downloads the package files and installs the package, but it will only cache the files instead of saving it.
